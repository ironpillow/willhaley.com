I used to have lengthy instructions on how to do this, but as OddballHero points out in the comments, this work has already been done.  No need to re-invent the wheel.  Here are the abridged instructions.  Feel free to contact me if you'd like the lengthy steps.

1. [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nslu2-general/files/Plug%20Files](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nslu2-general/files/Plug%20Files/)
1. Register to join the nslu2 Yahoo group.  It's quick and easy.
1. Check out the **plug.tar.gz file** (read the comments provided for that file).  It's an archive that has all the important files ready to go.  It can save you a lot of time and work.
1. You should also take a gander at the **profile** file they provide
1. Once you follow the instructions on the Yahoo group installing rsync is as simple as
    
```
ipkg install rsync
```
