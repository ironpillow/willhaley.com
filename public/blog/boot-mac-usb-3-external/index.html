<p>I have a <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/sp665?locale=en_US">Late 2012 21.5&rdquo; iMac</a> with a dying 5400 RPM Drive.</p>

<p>Backups are failing for reasons that are very ambiguous. All I know is that the machine keeps complaining that <code>Time Machine couldn't back up</code>, that the Time Machine drive constantly needed first aid, and then first aid would consistently fail with exit code <code>8</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/boot-mac-usb-3-external/time-machine.png" alt="time-machine.png" /></p>

<p>I realize that sounds much more like the Time Machine drive is at fault, and not the internal drive.</p>

<p>However, I replaced the Time Machine drive and enclosure with an SSD, and the issue persisted.</p>

<p>At this point, I decided that the underlying issue was that the internal fusion drive was failing.</p>

<p>I was seeing very slow performance and system hangs that required a hard shutdown, and took that as a hint that the drive was dying and causing this corruption I was seeing with Time Machine.</p>

<h1 id="replacing-the-boot-drive-on-an-imac-or-not">Replacing The Boot Drive On An iMac&hellip;Or Not</h1>

<p>I was originally planning to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHVOCoi6Q6E">replace the internal drive</a> in my iMac with an SSD. The process is certainly doable, but I hate the idea of cracking open the iMac, taking apart components, and re-applying glue. It seems like so much can go wrong.</p>

<p>Eventually, it hit me, modern Macs have the built-in ability to boot from an external drive. Why not boot from that rather than try to replace the internal drive?</p>

<p>I read that others had <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2907125/use-an-external-ssd-to-make-an-old-mac-feel-new-without-cracking-it-open.html">great success</a> booting externally like this, and it <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2013/06/22/boot-mac-external-drive/">seems</a> <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/112351/can-i-boot-mac-from-an-external-hard-drive-internal-hard-drivehard-drive-closu">like</a> something that is very commonly done with Macs.</p>

<p>At this point I decided I would be booting externally, and forgo the internal hard drive upgrade.</p>

<h1 id="usb-3-0-or-thunderbolt-1">USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt 1?</h1>

<p>My iMac has both USB 3.0 and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204154">Thunderbolt 1 ports</a> and did a lot of research to try and determine which connection was ideal for booting an external drive.</p>

<p><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/external-ssd-as-boot-drive-usb-3-vs-thunderbolt.1709803/">Some posts</a> warned that USB 3.0 does not support TRIM, but that the performance is essentially the same.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/thunderbolt-ssd-enclosure.1708619/#post-18803508">also</a> <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/imac-bto-which-is-which.1708796/#post-18803060">noticed</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Attached_SCSI">UASP</a> support in the USB 3.0 enclosure would reportedly <a href="https://blog.startech.com/post/all-you-need-to-know-about-uasp/">make a great difference</a>.</p>

<p>I compared both my <a href="/blog/thunderbolt-enclosure/">Thunderbolt enclosure</a> and <a href="/blog/usb-3-uasp/">USB 3.0 with UASP enclosure</a> for booting my Mac, and found that booting macOS from <strong>USB 3.0 performed better than Thunderbolt</strong>, and was far cheaper.</p>

<p>Based on my tests, I think USB 3.0 is the best way to go, and that is what I ended up using. Though, Thunderbolt is nearly as fast and seems like a perfectly viable option too.</p>

<h1 id="installing-macos">Installing macOS</h1>

<p>I rebooted my iMac to the recovery partition and installed macOS to my external drive.</p>

<p>The install seemed much slower than I would have hoped. The &ldquo;8 minutes remaining&rdquo; turned into 20 minutes. This was disheartening. I was convinced there was no way this would work.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I did not prematurely stop the installation. I let it finish, the machine rebooted to the external drive, and it ran wonderfully!</p>

<p>My Mac automatically defaulted to booting to the external drive, and everything was very snappy and worked great. Yay!</p>

<p>Write performance went from ~82.3 MiB/s to ~339 MiB/s</p>

<pre><code># Before
cat /dev/zero | pv -t -a &gt; /tmp/garbage.file
19:42 [82.3MiB/s]
</code></pre>

<pre><code># After
cat /dev/zero | pv -t -a &gt; /tmp/garbage.file
0:02:14 [ 339MiB/s]
</code></pre>

<p>I used the migration assistant to transfer data and everything worked perfectly. Time Machine backups are now working without issue.</p>

<p>The only remaining task for me is to wipe the internal drive to prevent accidentally booting to it in the future.</p>
