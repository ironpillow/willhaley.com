    <p>I knew that <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#names">naming</a>, specifically as it relates to capitalization, was how we control exports in Golang.</p>

<p>It was not until I was using the language for a couple weeks that I realized the implications behind this.</p>

<p>Exports in Go, which are controlled by naming conventions, are very similar to the concepts of <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> we see in other languages.</p>

<pre><code>package abc

// This will be exported. It is essentially public to other packages that
// import package abc. All because it is uppercased!
type Something1 struct {}

// This will not be exported. It is essentially private and inaccessible to
// packages that import package abc. All because it is lowercased!
type something2 struct {}
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->

<p>Since a capital letter means something will be exported, and a lowercase letter means it will not be exported, we can have structs and other data, functions, and methods, that are private in the scope of a package.</p>

<p>I think it is important to note that there is different semantic meaning behind exports in Go vs <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> in a language like Java. They may seem similar, but are definitely different concepts. However, using familiar terms like that helped me understand their power in Go.</p>

<p>It helped me think of the different patterns we can apply in packages</p>

<p>See an example (using a couple files) below.</p>

<p>I have a <code>cars</code> package used in this <code>main.go</code> file. By controlling the visibility inside the <code>cars</code> package, we can encourage patterns like having a constructor helper function for instantiating new structs. This way, we can hide the ability to create a struct literal and control the instantiation.</p>

<pre><code>// main.go
package main

import (
	&quot;./cars&quot;

	&quot;fmt&quot;
)

func main() {
	// This will not work, because car is not exported from cars.go. The car
	// struct is lowercase. main.go cannot instantiate a literal car struct.
	// var car *cars.car
	// car = &amp;cars.car{}

	// This works great. We export the NewCar method to create a constructor
	// for car structs. The car struct remains encapsulated in the package.
	car := cars.NewCar()

	// We can call this method just fine since it is exported.
	car.HonkTheHorn()

	// Attempting to call this method would produce an error since it is not
	// exported in the cars package.
	// car.secretHonk()

	// This works because Wheels is uppercased and exported.
	fmt.Println(car.Wheels)

	// This will not work because speed is lowercased and not exported.
	// fmt.Println(car.speed)
}

// This will not work since cars.car is not exported.
// func doThing1(car *cars.car) {
// 	// Do something.
// }

// This will work if we rely on a generic interface.
func doThing2(car *interface{}) {
	// Do something.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the cars package used by main.</p>

<pre><code>// cars/cars.go
package cars

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
)

// This struct is lowercased. Packages that import `cars` will not be able
// to instantiate a literal car.
type car struct {
	// This will not be exported.
	speed int
	// This will be exported.
	Wheels int
}

// This func is uppercased. Packages that import `cars` can instantiate a
// new car using this method. This allows us more control around car creation.
func NewCar() car {
	return car{}
}

// Lowercased method name. It is not visible outside this package.
func (car car) secretHonk() {
	fmt.Println(&quot;Shhh! h o n k  h o n k&quot;)
}

// Uppercased method name. It is visible outside this package.
func (car car) HonkTheHorn() {
	car.secretHonk()

	fmt.Println(&quot;HONK HONK! I am a car!&quot;)
}
</code></pre>

<p>This begged an interesting question for me. If <code>car</code> is not exported, how can it be used in <code>main.go</code>? How does <code>main.go</code> understand what a <code>car</code> can do?</p>

<p>I experimented by trying to re-define how we handle the result of the <code>NewCar</code> call.</p>

<pre><code>// main.go
var car *cars.car
car = cars.NewCar()
</code></pre>

<p>That returns the following error.</p>

<pre><code>./main.go:11: cannot refer to unexported name cars.car
</code></pre>

<p>This seems odd. How can <code>main.go</code> instantiate a car if it cannot use the unexported <code>cars.car</code>?</p>

<p>How does this work at all?</p>

<pre><code>car := cars.NewCar()
</code></pre>

<p>I do not really have an answer to that. I can only assume that because exported methods like <code>HonkTheHorn</code> exist, we don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> to have access to <code>cars.car</code> in order to call methods against it.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the following behavior.</p>

<pre><code>// main.go

// This will not work since cars.car is not exported.
// func doThing1(car *cars.car) {
// 	// Do something.
// }

// This will work since we rely on a generic interface.
func doThing2(car *interface{}) {
	// Do something.
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we uncomment <code>doThing1</code> we get a compile error because, again, <code>cars.car</code> is not exported.</p>

<p>So by keeping the <code>car</code> struct unexported we can call exported (public-esque) methods on it, but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to note these cases.</p>

<pre><code>// main.go

// This works because Wheels is uppercased and exported.
fmt.Println(car.Wheels)

// This will not work because speed is lowercased and not exported.
// fmt.Println(car.speed)
</code></pre>

<p>Although <code>car</code> is not exported, it can have fields that are exported.</p>

<p>My simple observation is that you can use whatever is exported, and everything else is blackbox to importing packages.</p>

<p>Not a very technical conclusion, but I think that basically sums it up, and the way that functionality is enforced in Go does seem pretty sensible and logical to me.</p>
