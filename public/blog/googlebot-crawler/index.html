<p>I recently created a trivial demo SPA (single page app) with <a href="https://www.emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>. I wanted to see how Google might naturally crawl my site and index it for Google Search results.</p>

<p>My website is using a very unique and nonsensical name that overlaps with <em>no other</em> search results, so it was easy to search on and see what was and was not indexed. Initially, Google had no search results for my site&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p><img src="/images/googlebot-crawler/no-seo.png" alt="no search results for my site" /></p>

<p>I created a <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en">Google Webmaster</a> entry for my trivial site and used the <code>Fetch as Google</code> tool to <code>Fetch and Render</code> my site.</p>

<p><img src="/images/googlebot-crawler/fetch.png" alt="fetch site as Google" /></p>

<p>I also clicked <code>Request Indexing</code> so that Google would <code>Crawl this URL and its direct links</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/googlebot-crawler/index.png" alt="index site" /></p>

<p>I waited a few days to see how Google had indexed my content.</p>

<p>The home page was indexed, as was the <code>/api</code> page, but some of my content was not searchable and did not seem to be picked up by Google at all. Specifically, I noticed the <code>/about</code> page was not indexed, which seemed odd since it was directly linked from my home page.</p>

<p><img src="/images/googlebot-crawler/some-content-indexed.png" alt="some results" /></p>

<p>My <code>robots.txt</code> allows all, so nothing should be blocked for Googlebot. And although I have no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps">Sitemap</a>, which would &ldquo;&hellip;inform search engines about URLs on a website that are available for crawling.&rdquo;, my content had a number of links that should have been crawable by Googlebot.</p>

<p>I looked at the result of <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/googlebot-fetch">Google&rsquo;s Webmaster Crawl Tool</a> to <code>Fetch as Google</code> my <code>/</code> home (index) page URL.</p>

<p>It was at this point I realized that Google&rsquo;s crawl process was not seeing my nav bar. The navigation was completely missing from Google&rsquo;s crawl and render of my site.</p>

<p>The result of that crawl request does not show my nav bar even though I can see the nav bar in my modern browser. Google states that &ldquo;This is how Googlebot saw the page:&rdquo; and &ldquo;This is how a visitor to your website would have seen the page:&ldquo;. See here a screenshot of the result.</p>

<p><img src="/images/googlebot-crawler/missing-nav.png" alt="no nav visible when rendered by googlebot" /></p>

<p>That same navigation bar in my single page app renders without issue in production in Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. See here a screenshot of what the home page (<code>/</code>) looks like in Chrome <code>62.0.3202.94 (Official Build) (64-bit)</code>. Note the nav bar at the top.</p>

<p><img src="/images/googlebot-crawler/nav-renders.png" alt="screenshot of website with nav" /></p>

<p>At this point I was perplexed. Clearly Googlebot was having an issue with an aspect of my site, but I had a hard time understanding why Google would vary so significantly from what I could see in my browser. <strong>If I can see the nav bar in my modern browser, why can&rsquo;t Googlebot?</strong> <strong>Why is the navigation bar not rendered by Google&rsquo;s crawl process?</strong></p>

<h1 id="why-is-the-navigation-bar-not-rendered-by-google-s-crawl-process">Why is the navigation bar not rendered by Google&rsquo;s crawl process?</h1>

<p>The nav bar had a <code>linear-gradient</code> css rule. If that rule is removed, the nav bar renders fine when using the <code>Fetch and Render</code> tool in the Google Webmaster Search Console. It is interesting to note that this one CSS rule seems to prevent the entire navigation DOM element from rendering properly by Googlebot.</p>

<p>So, this does not seem to be an SPA/AJAX-driven site problem, but rather a CSS problem for Googlebot&rsquo;s rendering process.</p>

<p>Googlebot is either unable or unwilling to process the <code>linear-gradient</code>, and the resulting CSS sans <code>linear-gradient</code> is not rendered by Googlebot.</p>

<p>Once I removed the <code>linear-gradient</code> and changed the <code>background</code> to a simple color, Googlebot could see my nav bar.</p>

<p><img src="/images/googlebot-crawler/fixed.png" alt="navigation rendering normally" /></p>

<h1 id="if-i-can-see-the-nav-bar-in-my-modern-browser-why-can-t-googlebot">If I can see the nav bar in my modern browser, why can&rsquo;t Googlebot?</h1>

<p>I initially assumed my nav bar issue was somehow because I was using an SPA despite Google <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/10/deprecating-our-ajax-crawling-scheme.html">saying the following regarding an AJAX-powered SPA like the one I am using</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, as long as you&rsquo;re not blocking Googlebot from crawling your JavaScript or CSS files, we are generally able to render and understand your web pages like modern browsers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although that statement is in regards to Javascript heavy/client-side sites, it seems clear to me now that it applies to <em>all</em> the content they crawl. My understanding now is that <strong>Googlebot does <em>not always</em> render and understand your website like a modern browser would.</strong></p>

<p>Based on Google&rsquo;s statement about crawling, I had assumed that if I can see the content with my human eye in my modern browser for my website, then Google&rsquo;s crawl process via Googlebot should be able to render and analyze that content too, but clearly that is not the case. <strong>It has nothing to do with my site being an SPA</strong>. Rather, it is because my site was using a CSS rule that did not play well with Googlebot.</p>

<p>Googlebot is <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/rendering">based on an older build of Chrome. Specifically, a build of version 41</a>. It is possible to <a href="http://google-chrome.en.uptodown.com/ubuntu/old">install Chrome 41</a> on a <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/">compatible OS</a>. I did so, and I do see the nav bar renders fine on a desktop with Chrome 41 and works as expected. See here the nav bar rendering fine in Chrome <code>41.0.2272.89 (64-bit)</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/googlebot-crawler/chrome41.png" alt="nav renders fine in chrome 41" /></p>

<p>Although my site works fine on Chrome 41, the issue with my site and Googlebot seems to be a case where it must be noted that <strong>Googlebot&rsquo;s web rendering service (WRS) is <em>not</em> the same as Chrome</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://moz.com/blog/google-shares-details-googlebot">Other articles</a> highlight this discrepency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From what we noticed, Google Search Console renders CSS a little bit different than Chrome 41. This doesn’t happen often, but as with most tools, we need to double check whenever possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Although the immediate fix for this was updating my CSS, my fundamental confusion and interest is <em>why</em> Googlebot does not behave like a modern browser for this CSS rule. The CSS works fine in Chrome 41, so why not in Googlebot?</p>

<p>I have <a href="/blog/linear-gradient-background-googlebot/">another article</a> that may answer that question thanks to the comment by Daniel Aleksandersen.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, my takeaway is that <strong>Googlebot is <em>not</em> the same as Chrome</strong>. It does not render content the same, and it is clear to me now that modern CSS can cause issues for Googlebot and prevent content from being crawled.</p>

<p><strong>Test your site against Google&rsquo;s Webmaster Tools early and often.</strong></p>
