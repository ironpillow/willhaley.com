<h1 id="first-consider-tethering">First, Consider Tethering</h1>

<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://willhaley.com/blog/linux-usb-wifi/#comment-3695819134">@roland in the comments</a> you may find that the easiest, cheapest, fastest, and most reliable way to get a USB WiFi connection on your Linux box is by using USB tethering with your smartphone.</p>

<p>This is possible natively in <a href="https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/3134/can-i-use-my-android-device-as-wi-fi-adapter-for-my-pc-i-e-tethering-to-pc-thr">Android</a>. It is not possible with <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/31182/share-iphone-wifi-with-computer-over-usb">iOS</a> unless iOS is jailbroken. iOS can share its <em>cellular</em> connection over USB natively, but not its <em>WiFi</em> connection unless it is jailbroken.</p>

<p>A Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (which <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-3-model-bplus-sale-now-35/">supports 802.11ac 5Ghz</a>) can <a href="/blog/raspberry-pi-wifi-ethernet-bridge/">also be used to accomplish a similar result</a>, but using ethernet rather than USB.</p>

<p>I recommend considering some form of tethering before buying a USB WiFi device for the reasons explained below. Generally speaking, USB WiFi in Linux is a tricky thing to get right.</p>

<h1 id="linux-wifi-warnings">Linux WiFi Warnings</h1>

<p>Read <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi">the Introduction in the Debian WiFi article</a> before diving into Linux and USB WiFi devices. Also, feel free to read about <a href="/blog/finding-linux-wifi-usb/">my own experiences on this topic</a>. I rewrote this article after a <a href="#comment-3480480313">helpful commenter</a> pointed out <a href="/blog/finding-linux-wifi-usb/">how problematic it is</a> to recommend USB WiFi devices for Linux. <em>Most</em> manufacterers do not play well with Linux, with some <a href="#tpe-n150usb-great-for-linux">notable exceptions</a>.</p>

<p>Ever wonder some <a href="/blog/finding-linux-wifi-usb/#marketing-and-sales-confusion">Amazon reviews have conflicting reports</a> about Linux support? Read those articles I just listed! It is <a href="/blog/finding-linux-wifi-usb/#chipset-inconsistency">almost impossible to know which chipset one will receive when buying most USB WiFi devices</a> except when buying <a href="https://www.thinkpenguin.com/catalog/wireless-networking-gnulinux">üêß ThinkPenguin device</a>.</p>

<p>I understand that ThinkPenguin devices may not be ideal for everyone. I am listing other, <em>non-ThinkPenguin devices</em>, that I have tested. However, for the reasons I stated above, it is a gamble whether or not they will work for everyone. ThinkPenguin devices are a much simpler option for Linux. Unfortunately, ThinkPenguin devices lack 802.11ac support and are a bit more expensive.</p>

<p><strong>You are responsible for your own purchasing decisions and I make no guarantees!</strong></p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> an exhaustive list. I have <em>not</em> purchased hundreds of cards. I have purchased several cards, and am ranking only the cards <em>I own</em>. As an average Linux user, I will do the best I can to relate what I found so that it may help others.</p>

<p><em>All cards were tested using Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS Xenial Xerus <code>4.10.0-37-generic #41~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 6 22:42:59 UTC 2017</code> against a server running iperf 3.0.11. Each test was performed over a period of 4 hours. See <a href="https://github.com/williamhaley/wifi-testing">my wifi-testing repo</a> if you are interested.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/penguin-wireless-n-usb-adapter-gnu-linux-tpe-n150usb">Penguin Wireless N USB Adapter for GNU / Linux (TPE-N150USB)</a></p>

<p><strong>Chipset</strong>: <a href="https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/penguin-wireless-n-usb-adapter-gnu-linux-tpe-n150usb">AR9271</a></p>

<p>The TPE-N150USB performed very reliably in my tests. Download speeds averaged <code>31.16 Mbps</code> and upload speeds averaged <code>11.58 Mbps</code>. The <code>max</code> speeds never topped <code>40.0 Mbps</code>, but I found that the overall consistency in performance was stellar.</p>

<p>From the research I have done, I would say this is going to be the most reliable Linux supported mini USB WiFi networking interface a consumer can except to find.</p>

<p>This card is <a href="https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/penguin-wireless-n-usb-adapter-gnu-linux-tpe-n150usb">supported by the Linux Kernel</a>, which means that no special intervention is required to get this NIC to work. Just plug it in. It also <a href="https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/penguin-wireless-n-usb-adapter-gnu-linux-tpe-n150usb">supports Monitor mode</a>, which is great for security analysis. Since ThinkPenguin uses reliable chipsets we can have confidence that we will receive the chipset that was advertised.</p>

<p>This card is my favorite considering the size, performance consistency, and Linux support.</p>

<p>The TPE-N150USBL performed very reliably in my tests. Download speeds averaged <code>32.25 Mbps</code> and upload speeds averaged <code>17.35 Mbps</code>. The <code>max</code> speeds never topped <code>40.0 Mbps</code>, but I found that the overall consistency in performance was stellar.</p>

<p>This card seems to be almost identical to the TPE-N150USB. Both cards use the same chipset, same vendor ids, same product ids, and had almost identical performance statistics. This card was a tad faster, but it seems the difference in speeds is very slight. The external antenna on the TPE-N150USBL did not make much difference in testing. In my opinion, this card is not worth the additional cost compared to the TPE-N150USB.</p>

Performance and support for this card <strong>will</strong> vary based on which chipset it ships with.</span></p>

<p>Getting this device to work on Linux was complicated. There <a href="https://github.com/diederikdehaas/rtl8812AU">are</a> <a href="https://github.com/gordboy/rtl8812au">multiple</a> <a href="https://github.com/abperiasamy/rtl8812AU_8821AU_linux">drivers</a> by <a href="https://github.com/gnab/rtl8812au">multiple</a> <a href="https://github.com/sloretz/rtl8811au">authors</a> for this chipset. None of these linked drivers worked for me.</p>

<p>I tried multiple variations of the <a href="http://www.edimax.com/edimax/download/download/data/edimax/au/download/for_home/wireless_adapters/wireless_adapters_ac600_dual-band/ew-7811utc">official Edimax driver code</a>, but none of the Edimax drivers built successfully for me, and I did not want to spend time debugging their build scripts.</p>

<p>I found that the <a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/kernel/rtl8812au-dkms">Ubuntu package for this driver</a> would not build on my (vanilla) Ubuntu install either.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.danielscrivano.com/installing-rtl8812au-on-linux-for-wireless-dual-band-usb-adapters/">This article</a> finally helped me find a working driver. For me, the working driver was the <a href="https://github.com/scrivy/rtl8812AU_8821AU_linux">rtl8812AU_8821AU_linux driver by scrivy</a>.</p>

<p>Once working, this card seemed <strong>blazing fast</strong> (relative to other Linux WiFi adapters that I tested) for me on Ubuntu 16.04.3. The performance boost came from 802.11ac. With 802.11ac I saw download speeds average <code>64.16 Mbps</code> and upload speeds average <code>59.42 Mbps</code>.</p>

<p>Overall, the performance of this card seemed very reliable for me.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> this is clearly not a well supported device on Linux, there are risks in downloading software from random repos, there are <strong><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Edimax_EW-7811UTC_7392_A812">multiple versions</a></strong> of this device sold by Edimax, I only tested on Ubuntu, others may well <a href="/blog/finding-linux-wifi-usb/">receive a different chipset that I did</a>, and there is no guarantee this card will work for everyone.</p>

<p><em>This is the only 802.11ac card I tested. Speeds are all for my 802.11ac network.</em></p>

<p>It is relatively cheap, worked out of the box, and connected to my AP without issue. The chipset I received supports monitor mode, but <a href="/blog/finding-linux-wifi-usb/">it is very likely others who buy this card may not have a chipset that supports monitor mode</a>. Compared to the other cards here, <strong>I would say the performance is very unreliable</strong>.</p>

<p>Just look at the wide range of download and upload speeds below. I re-ran these tests multiple times at different times of day (and overnight) and the speeds are very inconsistent in all test cases.</p>

<p>I have only seen one reported chipset for this device in my research, but as I warn multiple times, that is <a href="/blog/finding-linux-wifi-usb/">no guarantee that the card others receive will have the same chipset as mine</a>.</p>
