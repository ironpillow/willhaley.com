<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>Pros for the Bravo 2.0:</p>

<ul>
<li>Very comfortable main straps and sternum strap</li>
<li>Padded back</li>
<li>Waterproof <strong>main</strong> compartment with rolltop</li>
<li>Strong velcro</li>
<li>A couple exterior pockets</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons for the Bravo 2.0:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Laptop compartment is not waterproof</strong></li>
<li>Velcro is loud, and cuts into the back of my hand</li>
<li>Takes a bit of finagling to fit all my commuter gear</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="details">Details</h1>

<p>I love the feel of this bag compared to others I&rsquo;ve tried, and I find the design simple and elegant. Though, there are a few design choices that I found odd, as noted below.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/exterior.jpg" alt="Rolltop closed">
    
    <figcaption>Rolltop closed</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little smaller than my old 32 liter North Face Bigshot II, but still holds 28 liters and has a rolltop which allows for extra storage capacity.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/rolltop.jpg" alt="Rolltop open">
    
    <figcaption>Rolltop open</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>I&rsquo;m able to fit my typical daily commuting cargo gear, and I&rsquo;m <em>just barely</em> able to fit my &ldquo;extended day&rdquo; cargo gear without needing to flip the roll top.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/extended-day-cargo.jpg" alt="More cargo than I might typically haul">
    
    <figcaption>More cargo than I might typically haul</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>My &ldquo;extended&rdquo; cargo load is a little larger than my typical one because I&rsquo;m including spare shoes and a sweatshirt, which I normally only pack for special occasions. I usually keep an extra sweatshirt and pair of shoes at the office.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/extended-day-cargo-in-bag.jpg" alt="Cargo in bag. This was a first attempt. I was able to get the rolltop squashed a bit more on my second try">
    
    <figcaption>Cargo in bag. This was a first attempt. I was able to get the rolltop squashed a bit more on my second try</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Unfortunately, I discovered that I have to pack my laptop <em>before</em> my cargo. The internal space used by the laptop compartment and the main compartment collide a bit, and it takes a bit of rearranging to get things right. Loading my laptop first seems the best solution for me.</p>

<p>Based on how severely the cargo from the main compartment can creep into the laptop compartment&rsquo;s space, I feel much safer using a dedicated laptop case/sleeve before loading my laptop.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/laptop-in-sleeve.jpg" alt="15&#34; MacBook Pro in sleeve">
    
    <figcaption>15&#34; MacBook Pro in sleeve</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Even with all that gear, the padded back feels pretty comfy. It doesn&rsquo;t contour to my back quite as well as I&rsquo;d like though. With all backpacks I find I have a difficult time striking the balance between a rigid back that doesn&rsquo;t allow my cargo to stab into me and a back with enough contouring that I&rsquo;m not aching the next day from having a big flat surface pressed against my spine.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/padded-back.jpg" alt="Padded back and straps">
    
    <figcaption>Padded back and straps</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The bag has some mildly ambiguous waterproof phrasing on the Chrome website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Featuring a welded-waterproof main compartment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find that phrasing a bit ambiguous because the bag is listed as &ldquo;Weatherproof&rdquo;, and other bags on the Chrome website say they are &ldquo;100% waterproof&rdquo;. After some analysis, it&rsquo;s clear why Chrome does not call this bag &ldquo;100% waterproof&rdquo;.</p>

<p><em>Only</em> the main compartment is waterproof and <em>not</em> the laptop compartment or other compartments. There may be water resistant material in various spots on the bag, but only the main compartment seems truly waterproof, which is a bit problematic as explained below.</p>

<p>The bag apparently uses &ldquo;Abrasion-resistant 1050d nylon&rdquo;, and for this material Chrome says they &ldquo;coat the back with polyurethane for extra water resistance.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m assuming this nylon is the material used over the majority of the exterior.</p>

<p>The interior has a tarpaulin liner, which comprises the &ldquo;welded-waterproof main compartment&rdquo;.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/waterproof-interior.jpg" alt="Waterproof main compartment">
    
    <figcaption>Waterproof main compartment</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>There&rsquo;s another velcroed compartment accessible from the main pocket. I had mistaken this as the laptop compartment at first.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/interior.jpg" alt="Velcroed area in main compartment">
    
    <figcaption>Velcroed area in main compartment</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This velcroed compartment runs along the back of the bag and it does not seem to be waterproof from what I can tell.</p>

<p>This velcroed area off the main compartment is not a separate pocket. It essentially allows you to get <em>behind</em> the waterproof liner all the way to the bottom of the bag. So any items put in there are immediately taking space away from the main compartment. I&rsquo;m assuming it is intended for wet items like gym clothes.</p>

<p>At first I mistook it for the laptop compartment, but after taking a closer look, I think I should <em>never</em> use this for my laptop as it could be more exposed to the elements.</p>

<p>I then discovered The &ldquo;Dedicated laptop compartment&rdquo; and was glad to find that it did fit my 15&rdquo; Apple MacBook Pro <em>including</em> the dedicated laptop sleeve I use.</p>

<p>I had a rather difficult time finding a Chrome bag that fit my laptop plus sleeve, so I was really satisfied when I found this fit in the Bravo 2.0.</p>

    <figcaption>Another view of my laptop sleeve fitting in the Chome Bravo 2.0</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The exterior facing wall on the inside of the laptop compartment seems to be waterproof, but not <em>every</em> side of the laptop compartment is waterproof, which is frustrating, as another Chrome reviewer points out <a href="https://www.chromeindustries.com/product/bravo-2.0-backpack/BG-190.html?dwvar_BG-190_size=NA&amp;dwvar_BG-190_color=GRGY&amp;cgid=view_all_bags">on their website</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most frustratingly though, the roll-top section is the only truly weatherproof section of the bag, NOT THE LAPTOP SECTION ( note laptops do not like water). Rain has a nasty tendency to pool in the outside top seems of the laptop compartment due to the design of the bag. I got caught out in a storm in San Francisco and was less then delighted to find my laptop was covered in water, in a properly closed bag, due to these pools quickly inundating the fabric and creating leaks. My laptop now requires repair, not ideal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My worst fear! No-one wants a ruined laptop.</p>

<p>Another review on this same bag from <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/891305/chrome-bravo-20-bike-pack">REI&rsquo;s website</a> agrees with my mindset here that the lack of waterproofing for electronics is an odd choice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) The main compartment of the bag is waterproof, but the area where you put your computer, phone and other electronic devices is not. This makes no sense to me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think making the laptop compartment waterproof like the main compartment would&rsquo;ve made much more sense, or at least having the laptop compartment be <em>inside</em> the main compartment to share that waterproofing.</p>

<p>I <em>could</em> put my laptop in the main waterproof compartment, but I&rsquo;d rather not. I like to put my clothes and rough cargo in the main pocket and have a dedicated compartment for my laptop. The idea of having a laptop compartment, but not feeling comfortable putting my laptop inside it, is a bit frustrating. Especially after having recently suffered water damage with a different backpack after getting caught in the rain without an umbrella.</p>

<p>The sides (left) and backing (top of the photo) of the laptop compartment do not seem to use a waterproof material. The shiny side (bottom) does, which makes sense, since that&rsquo;s the side facing out and would be most exposed to the elements.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/laptop-compartment.jpg" alt="Laptop compartment with only partial waterproofing material">
    
    <figcaption>Laptop compartment with only partial waterproofing material</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>I should pause here to note that I do not <em>really</em> know just how resistant the laptop compartment is to rain, but considering how Chrome carefully uses the term &ldquo;waterproof&rdquo; in describing this bag, and looking at other reviews, and feeling it myself, I would not be comfortable with the safety of my laptop if I was stuck in a hard rain.</p>

<p>See here for an external view of the laptop compartment side. It seems the side walls of the laptop compartment use the same material outside as in (the 1050d nylon I suppose).</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/laptop-compartment-side.jpg" alt="External view of laptop compartment">
    
    <figcaption>External view of laptop compartment</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The lid flap of the laptop compartment seems to use the same waterproof (again, I <em>think</em> it&rsquo;s waterproof) material as the flap that covers the roll top. This makes me feel better about the waterproofing, but I&rsquo;m still a little nervous that every side of the laptop compartment is not waterproofed like I hoped. Especially considering that review from another Chrome user I posted above.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/laptop-compartment-top.jpg" alt="Waterproof (?) or at least, water resistant, lid for laptop compartment">
    
    <figcaption>Waterproof (?) or at least, water resistant, lid for laptop compartment</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The design of the laptop storage with a bag like the <a href="https://www.chromeindustries.com/product/barrage-cargo-backpack/BG-163.html">Chrome Barrage Cargo Backpack</a> makes more sense to me since the laptop storage is <em>inside</em> the main waterproof compartment on that bag.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m at a bit of a loss when it comes to the usefullness of the straps. I suppose you could tighten/loosen them as your cargo fluctuates, but the main interior compartment is so rigid that I have a difficult time imagining they would make much difference.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/straps.jpg" alt="Chrome Bravo 2.0 straps">
    
    <figcaption>Chrome Bravo 2.0 straps</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>I had not planned on using these exterior cargo/cinch straps, but I don&rsquo;t see their value either. Perhaps good for hauling a yoga mat or something similar that&rsquo;s fairly large and has some natural friction to it, but I&rsquo;d be afraid to put anything of value there for fear it could slide out the bottom.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a smaller front zipper pocket that could be handy for items like a wallet. Based on the feel I <em>think</em> this has a waterproof lining around it.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/small-pocket.jpg" alt="Smaller external pocket">
    
    <figcaption>Smaller external pocket</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The part of this bag I like least is the velcro. I&rsquo;m generally averse to velcro because, in my mind, it&rsquo;s going to wear out faster than a simple fastener like a buckle, clip, or snap. The velcro is the only mechanism used to seal the rolltop main compartment. Velcro is also the only mechanism to seal the laptop compartment as well.</p>

<p>I feel that velcro will attract dirt and dust and lint that decreases the viability. In reality, I have never used a bag with velcro before, so perhaps I should not be so quick to judge.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/velcro.jpg" alt="The velcro is strong, and the only way to close the rolltop flap">
    
    <figcaption>The velcro is strong, and the only way to close the rolltop flap</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The velcro on this bag is very loud, which I suppose is good because it&rsquo;s strong, but it&rsquo;s also awkward in quiet spaces when you need to grab something from your bag. It&rsquo;s also a bit of a pain to adjust the rolltop with velcro, in my opinion. I find that it takes at least a couple adjustments with the velcro to get the flap sealed to my satisfaction.</p>

<p>I would have preferred a large sturdy plastic buckle or two.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only used the bag a couple times and have been tinkering with it a bunch as I get a better feel for it and try different cargo loads. In that brief time the velcro between the wet/dry parts of the main compartment has managed to cut up my hand a bit as I fished around inside for things.</p>

<figure class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/chrome-bravo-2/velcro-hand-scratches.jpg" alt="Scratched hand from velcro">
    
    <figcaption>Scratched hand from velcro</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that sounds a bit silly, but I assure you it&rsquo;s very annoying. At first I thought it was an allergic reaction my skin was having to the waterproof material in the main compartment, then I realized the velcro on the bag is scraping my hand. Now I try and avoid using that separate &ldquo;wet&rdquo; compartment because I keep scratching myself.</p>

<p>Overall I love the feel and look, and although I have a lot of gripes, I do think it&rsquo;s a nice bag. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll work well for most people, but the lack of waterproofing on the laptop compartment has me wondering how comfortable I will be with this bag in the long term.</p>
