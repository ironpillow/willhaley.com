<p>So you want to encrypt your <code>$HOME</code> on your Mac but nothing else?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s stop right here.</p>

<p><strong>The built in option for FileVault full disk encryption is the standard on a Mac, and I recommend going that route for encryption. It is a fairly big pain to do what you&rsquo;re asking.</strong></p>

<p>Though, it is possible, and that is what this guide will help you to accomplish. Although it is complicated, it <em>is</em> possible to encrypt a user&rsquo;s home folder independently of the rest of the system. We can use a keyfile to encrypt our home, and automatically mount it at boot.</p>

<p>A couple caveats.</p>

<ol>
<li>Again, I have to stress, FileVault is <em>so much</em> simpler. Or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeraCrypt">VeraCrypt</a>.</li>
<li>You must be comfortable using a USB key to decrypt your drive.</li>
<li>My process works 99% of the time, but about once every few months my <code>$HOME</code> fails to mount properly and I must reboot to try again.</li>
</ol>

<p>Full disk encryption is better than partial disk encryption, and my process certainly has some holes. It is up to you to be as secure (paranoid) as you want.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="administrator-account">Administrator account</h2>

<p>Create an <code>Administrator</code> user on your Mac (with Administrator access of course) and log out of your account and log in as that user.</p>

<p>While it may be possible, I do not think it&rsquo;s a good idea to mess with the home folder of a user while that user is logged in. That is why I ask you to create the Administrator user account.</p>

<p>Not only should you use that secondary account to follow these instructions, but you should keep that account around and <strong>never encrypt its home</strong>.</p>

<p>Why? Well, if your encrypted home folder fails to mount at boot time for some reason, you may be locked out of your Mac. That&rsquo;s no fun. You can probably fix things via the recovery tools if that happens, but having a secondary admin account will greatly ease your burden if you need to troubleshoot. It&rsquo;s your choice, but be warned, if something goes wrong and you get locked out of your machine, it will probably be very frustrating and annoying.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-keyfile">Create a keyfile</h2>

<p>I believe that a keyfile is the only way to accomplish the goal of this article.</p>

<p>I cannot find any way to accomplish our goal using a password prompt. I don&rsquo;t think you can inject/prompt for a password in the standard boot process without using a file that can be read via script.</p>

<p>I am naming my keyfile <code>willencryptedhome.key</code>. The file should contain nothing but the password.</p>

<pre><code>thePassw0rd
</code></pre>

<p>That is a trivial example. In reality, this is how I generated my keyfile.</p>

<pre><code># 1023 chars is the longest allowed passphrase here.
cat /dev/urandom | env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 1023 | head -n 1 &gt; willencryptedhome.key
</code></pre>

<p>Find a USB drive. Bonus points if it has a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kanguru-Flash-Physical-Protect-switch/dp/B008OGNM8E">&ldquo;read only&rdquo; switch on it like the Kanguru USB drives that I use</a>.</p>

<p>Format the USB drive as MS-DOS (FAT), with a Master Boot Record, using Disk Utility. Name the drive <code>KEYDRIVE01</code> or something that&rsquo;s reasonably unique.</p>

<p>Copy your keyfile to the root of <code>KEYDRIVE01</code>.</p>

<p>You should backup this keyfile somewhere secure. If you lose it, you will forever lose access to your encrypted disk.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-our-encrypted-disk">Set up our encrypted disk</h2>

<p>I highly recommend using a dedicated disk to house this encrypted home of yours. What I mean is, a separate, distinct disk from your OS disk.</p>

<p>In my case, I&rsquo;m using a brand new ~500GB SSD drive to act as my encrypted home.</p>

<p>For clarity, I&rsquo;m going to refer to this disk as the &ldquo;encrypted home&rdquo;, even though it&rsquo;s not encrypted just yet.</p>

<p>With your machine powered off, plug in your new encrypted home disk to your Mac. Boot up and open up your terminal.</p>

<p>Find the id of the disk that will server as your encrypted home.</p>

<pre><code>diskutil list
</code></pre>

<p>My encrypted home disk is brand new and so has no partitions.</p>

<pre><code>/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:                                                   *480.1 GB   disk0
... etc ...
</code></pre>

<p>Be <strong>extremely</strong> certain that you&rsquo;re looking at the correct disk before proceeding. If you choose the wrong disk, you may lose data.</p>

<p>Create a <code>corestorage</code> <code>Logical Volume Group</code> on your encrypted home disk. <strong>Warning: this will erase the disk.</strong> Note that I am running this command against <code>/dev/disk0</code> based on the output of the command above. This will almost certainly <strong>not</strong> be the same for you, so read carefully!</p>

<p>I am using <code>ENCRYPTEDHOME</code> for the Core Storage logical volume group name, but you use whatever you like.</p>

<pre><code>diskutil corestorage create ENCRYPTEDHOME /dev/disk0
</code></pre>

<p>Your encrypted home disk layout should look something like this if you do another <code>diskutil list</code>.</p>

<pre><code>/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *480.1 GB   disk0
   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1
   2:          Apple_CoreStorage ENCRYPTEDHOME           479.8 GB   disk0s2
   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3
... etc ...
</code></pre>

<p>Create a volume inside the Core Storage <code>Logical Volume Group</code> that we just created a moment ago. I am calling <em>my</em> volume <code>WILLENCRYPTEDHOME</code>. You can name it however you like, but then make sure you use <em>your</em> updated name(s) in the rest of my steps.</p>

<pre><code>diskutil corestorage createVolume ENCRYPTEDHOME jhfs+ WILLENCRYPTEDHOME 100%
</code></pre>

<p>Encrypt your encrypted home disk Core Storage volume using the key we created earlier.</p>

<pre><code>cat /Volumes/KEYDRIVE01/willencryptedhome.key|diskutil corestorage encryptVolume WILLENCRYPTEDHOME -stdinpassphrase
</code></pre>

<h2 id="unlock-our-encrypted-disk-at-boot">Unlock our encrypted disk at boot</h2>

<p>Great. Now we have an encrypted drive and a USB key to unlock it, but how do we unlock it at boot when we need to login? OS X has no built in mechanism for this, so we&rsquo;ll have to script it ourselves.</p>

<p>Technically, we can&rsquo;t unlock the drive as part of the login process. At least, not to my knowledge. So, we must unlock the disk at boot time. We&rsquo;ll unlock it then using our USB key.</p>

<p>Get the UUID of your USB key.</p>

<pre><code>wills-iMac:~ will$ diskutil list | grep KEYDRIVE01
1:                  Apple_HFS KEYDRIVE01              1.9 GB     disk4s1
wills-iMac:~ will$ diskutil info disk4s1 | grep &quot;Volume UUID&quot;
Volume UUID:              35B0AB1F-AF54-3A8B-8C95-8DA9833CB0E1
</code></pre>

<p>Get the UUID of your encrypted <code>Logical Volume</code>. Note, it&rsquo;s the last item in the list.</p>

<pre><code>wills-iMac:~ will$ diskutil corestorage list | grep &quot;Logical Volume&quot;
+-- Logical Volume Group C3E498E5-BADE-4367-9979-D6E541D37989
    +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 7E96AFD1-3B18-4C48-8537-8491B35DF73A
        +-&gt; Logical Volume 0C4997C8-EE93-4723-813F-D60A50872B60
</code></pre>

<p>Create a file with the following contents at <code>/opt/mount.sh</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Replace <code>YOUR_USB_KEY_UUID</code> and <code>YOUR_ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_UUID</code> in the script below with the correct UUIDs for <em>your</em> USB key and encrypted volume found when you ran the commands above!</strong></p>

<p>Modify the script as needed for your system. For instance, your keyfile probably has a different file name than mine.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

USB_KEY_UUID=YOUR_USB_KEY_UUID
ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_UUID=YOUR_ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_UUID

LOG=/tmp/mount.log

echo &quot;mount attempted at $(date)&quot; &gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1

# Must ensure the USB key is mounted so we can access the keyfile.
diskutil mount $USB_KEY_UUID &gt;&gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1

diskutil list &gt;&gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1

KEY_NAME=$(diskutil info $USB_KEY_UUID | grep &quot;Volume Name&quot; | awk '{print $3}')

echo $KEY_NAME &gt;&gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1

# Read the key.
password=$(cat /Volumes/$KEY_NAME/willencryptedhome.key)

# Mount encrypted volume using the key.
printf $password|diskutil corestorage unlockVolume $ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_UUID -stdinpassphrase
</code></pre>

<p>Lock that script down a bit and make it executable.</p>

<pre><code>sudo chown root:wheel /opt/mount.sh
sudo chmod 500 /opt/mount.sh
sudo chmod +x /opt/mount.sh
</code></pre>

<p>OK, so how do we get that to run at boot?</p>

<p>Create a file at <code>/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.willhaley.mac.startup.mounthome.plist</code> using these contents.</p>

<p>Again, you can rename that file if you want, but make sure you update the name appropriately elsewhere!</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &quot;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;plist version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;true /&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.willhaley.mac.startup.mounthome&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/opt/mount.sh&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Set our mount script to run at boot.</p>

<pre><code>launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.willhaley.mac.startup.mounthome.plist
</code></pre>

<p>Now comes the ultimate test. Keep your USB key plugged in, and reboot. Log in as any user and verify that you can see your mounted drive in the Finder.</p>

<p>Create a new folder in your encrypted volume. Reboot.</p>

<p>Do you see your folder in the encrypted drive? Great. Data is persisting as we&rsquo;d hope.</p>

<p>Try unplugging your USB key and rebooting. You should see that the encrypted home disk does <em>not</em> mount now. Re-connect your USB key and reboot again.</p>

<p>Hopefully the encrypted home disk is mounting properly each time you reboot as long as the USB key is plugged in.</p>

<p>If your encrypted home is failing to mount automatically, take a step back and try to see where you went wrong.</p>

<p>Can you run the <code>mount.sh</code> script manually? Do you see any errors? Do you see a file created at <code>/tmp/mount.log</code> indicating that a mount was even attempted? Keep at it. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll figure it out, and my apologies if I left out a step.</p>

<h2 id="move-your-home-data-to-the-encrypted-disk">Move your $HOME data to the encrypted disk</h2>

<p>You may not have paid attention at the beginning, but to reiterate, I <strong>highly</strong> recommend that you log out of your account and log in as another administrator for these next steps.</p>

<p>Once you have logged in as another user, we can copy data from your old unencrypted home directory to the new encrypted home location.</p>

<pre><code>rsync -avr /Users/will/ /Volumes/WILLENCRYPTEDHOME/
</code></pre>

<h1 id="mount-your-encrypted-disk-as-your-new-home">Mount your encrypted disk as your new $HOME</h1>

<p>Our encrypted volume should mount automatically at boot now, but you&rsquo;ll note it&rsquo;s mounted under <code>/Volumes</code> by default. We do not want that. We want it mounted at <code>$HOME</code>. Although it&rsquo;s possible to re-define where <code>$HOME</code> is, or do a mount bind, I am not entirely comfortable messing with those. I feel like that would be very non-standard and may not play well on a Mac.</p>

<p>So instead, we will mount the encrypted home disk over our standard <code>/Users/$USER</code> path.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go back and edit our <code>/opt/mount.sh</code> script. We have a couple more lines to add.</p>

<p>At the bottom, add these lines so that from now on, your encrypted home volume will mount at <code>/Users/will</code> (or whatever is applicable).</p>

<pre><code># This looks odd, but I've found that occasionally it fails to unmount the first
# time, so adding a loop so we can re-try.
MAX_ATTEMPTS=10
ATTEMPT=0
while [ &quot;$(diskutil info $ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_UUID | grep -i &quot;Mounted&quot; | awk '{print $2}')&quot; == 'Yes' ] &amp;&amp; [ $ATTEMPT -lt $MAX_ATTEMPTS ]; do
  sleep 1
  echo &quot;$ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_UUID is mounted. Attempt: $ATTEMPT of $MAX_ATTEMPTS&quot; &gt;&gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1
  diskutil umount $ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_UUID &gt;&gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1
  ATTEMPT=$((ATTEMPT+1))
done

diskutil mount -mountPoint /Users/will $ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_UUID &gt;&gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<p>Reboot again. Your machine should now be using the encrypted volume as your <code>/Users/will</code> folder.</p>

<h2 id="clean-up">Clean up</h2>

<p>Once you&rsquo;re satisfied and your data is backed up securely and your USB key is backed up securely, then you should <strong>delete</strong> your old home directory at <code>/Users/will</code> (or wherever) from the unencrypted disk.</p>

<p>After all, what is the point of encrypting our <code>$HOME</code> if the old unencrypted data is still there in the open?</p>

<p><strong>Be extremely careful that you are deleting the data from the unencrypted disk, and not from your encrypted disk.</strong></p>

<p>These steps took a <em>lot</em> of trial and error. FileVault is a much safer and easier way to get encryption, and although I have not used VeraCrypt, it is probably much simpler too.</p>

<p>For any of this to be worthwhile, please don&rsquo;t leave your USB key plugged in to your Mac when you leave the house ;)</p>
