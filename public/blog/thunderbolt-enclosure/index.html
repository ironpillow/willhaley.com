<p>My research has led me to believe that there are no single-bay 2.5&rdquo; diskless Thunderbolt 1 enclosures.</p>

<p>The enclosures I have found all include at least one drive, and many of them are built using sleek unibody designs that do not seem conducive to replacing the hard drive.</p>

<p>I have decided that the only way to get an &ldquo;empty&rdquo; Thunderbolt 1 enclosure is to find an external Thunderbolt 1 device that already has a drive in it, and to then open it up and replace the hard drive within as needed.</p>

<p>Although I imagine that many Thunderbolt 1 drives could potentially be opened and have their drives upgraded, I ended up choosing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GHCUAKO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">LaCie Rugged Thunderbolt and USB 3.0 1TB Portable Hard Drive STEV1000400</a>.</p>

<p>It was affordable compared to many other Thunderbolt 1 drives, and it was the only device for which I could find any evidence that someone successfully opened it and upgraded the drive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9mglHTQWW0">LACIE 2TB USB 3.0 Thunderbolt Drive DISASSEMBLE / SSD SWAP</a>.</p>

<p>My model Lacie is not the same one as in that video, but thankfully the drives are so similar that the video applied to my drive as well, and was a huge help.</p>

<h1 id="performance">Performance</h1>

<p>I ran a performance test on my Lacie with the original hard drive. In my case, a 7200 RPM 1TB Seagate drive.</p>

<p>I connected it to my MacBook as an external drive and I wrote data to the disk for 15 minutes.</p>

<pre><code>cat /dev/zero | pv -a -t /dev/rdisk2
0:15:00 [ 130MiB/s]
</code></pre>

<p>The average speed was 130 MiB/s (1.090 Gbps).</p>

<p>After I upgraded the drive to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OBRE5UE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Samsung 850 EVO 500GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E500B/AM)</a>, I installed macOS to the drive and booted to it to do some other performance tests.</p>

<p>First, I booted to the drive using the Thunderbolt 1 interface, and wrote data to a garbage file on disk.</p>

<pre><code>cat /dev/zero | pv -a -t /tmp/garbage.file
0:02:00 [ 358MiB/s]
</code></pre>

<p>The average speed was 358 MiB/s (3.003 Gbps).</p>

<p>Finally, I booted to the drive using the UBS 3.0 interface, and wrote data to a garbage file on disk.</p>

<pre><code>cat /dev/zero | pv -a -t /tmp/garbage.file
0:03:00 [ 383MiB/s]
</code></pre>

<p>The average speed was 383 MiB/s (3.212 Gbps).</p>

<p>I was expecting Thunderbolt 1 to be faster than USB 3.0 since it has a theoretical max speed of 10 Gbps, but USB 3.0 was faster by a small margin.</p>

<p>If your goal is performance, and your options are USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt 1, these results would make me say it is worthwhile to save money and buy a USB 3.0 enclosure rather than attempting to do what I did here.</p>

<p><strong>It does not seem that Thunderbolt 1 provides any meaningful advantage over USB 3.0 in my simple tests.</strong></p>

<h1 id="dissasembly-and-upgrading-to-an-ssd">Dissasembly And Upgrading To An SSD</h1>

<p><strong>Warning: This WILL void your warranty</strong></p>

<p>The drive offers both USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt 1 connectivity.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thunderbolt-enclosure/1.jpg" alt="1.jpg" /></p>

<p>The Thunderbolt 1 cable is hard-wired.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thunderbolt-enclosure/2.jpg" alt="2.jpg" /></p>

<p>The USB 3.0 cable is detachable.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thunderbolt-enclosure/3.jpg" alt="3.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/thunderbolt-enclosure/6.jpg" alt="6.jpg" /></p>

<p>The drive is a breeze to disassemble.</p>

<p>The rubber casing can be removed simply by stretching it off.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thunderbolt-enclosure/4.jpg" alt="4.jpg" /></p>

<p>Underneath are four screws. These are the only screws that need to be removed.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thunderbolt-enclosure/5.jpg" alt="5.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can then slide the drive assembly out.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thunderbolt-enclosure/7.jpg" alt="7.jpg" /></p>

<p>You will have to peel off the magnetic tape. Unfortunately, you will probably end up breaking the tape, but I do not <em>think</em> that it serves a significant purpose, so I would not worry too much.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thunderbolt-enclosure/8.jpg" alt="8.jpg" /></p>

<p>The drive inside is a standard SATA drive. In my case, it is a 7200 RPM 1 TB drive.</p>

<p>At this point, you can simply slide the drive out of the SATA connector, install your new drive, and reverse these steps.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thunderbolt-enclosure/9.jpg" alt="9.jpg" /></p>

<p>Thankfully, it is all very straightforward.</p>
