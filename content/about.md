My name is Will Haley. I am a programmer, Chicagoan, bicyclist, friend to all dogs, open source proponent, and vetted nerd.

I attended school at [DePaul University](http://www.depaul.edu) in Chicago and [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/) in Ireland. I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Journera](https://journera.com/).

I'm a full stack polyglot, and learn best by doing. I enjoy volunteering my time to teach computer classes in my community and share my love of technology.

Right now I'm working mostly with Golang, Ember.js, Ruby, Swift, HTML, JS, Node.js, CSS, and always, bash.

I love simplicity, open-mindedness, and horrible B movies.
