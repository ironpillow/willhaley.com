This sort of behavior can be very frustrating.

Here we have a div that looks a lot like a clickable element. When one hovers over it, a border appears. Text changes. Yet, only the bottom half is clickable. This is very confusing.

The "Click me!" text was my own modification to obscure the original content of the page.
