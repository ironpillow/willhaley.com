# Details

The Swig has a simple straightforward design which is what drew me to it in the first place.

The biggest issue I had with the Swig was the overall storage space. It has a 16 liter capacity, which managed to fit the bare minimum I need for commuting, but nothing more.

This is the bare minimum cargo that I need for commuting. Unfortunately, I cannot fit anything more than this. No shoes, no sweatshirt, no lunch, no beer if I'm going to a friend's house after work, no variable gear that I might need to grab on errands. It just fits the bare minimum for me, which is rather limiting.

The flap on top buckles over the main compartment, but is not a rolltop. I found that the flap did a good job of covering the compartment, but it seems that if I'm not careful, there's space at the corners of the flaps where rain could get in if the material is folded at an odd angle.

The top flap on the black version of the Swig has a bright neon lining. It seems like this is a water-resistant material, but nowhere on Timbuk2's website does it say anything about waterproofing or water-resistance for this bag. I'm not sure how well I trust this to protect my expensive laptop from the elements.

There are several zipped pockets along the front of the bag. It's a tight squeeze to reach in them when the bag is loaded to capacity.

A zipper running along the side of the bag from bottom to top allows access to the laptop pocket off the main compartment. I had to angle my 15" MacBook Pro to get it in and out of that zipper, but it did work.

I found that the bag felt fairly uncomfortable when fully loaded. Although it's not clearly bulging, it certainly felt that way against my back.

The straps are comfortable enough. When the bag is fully loaded the straps stick out a bit and do not contour well to my shoulders and chest, but when the bag is unloaded, the straps and back are reasonably comfortable.

It's only at full capacity that I really notice any discomfort, but based on my cargo load, that's bad news for me. I tried adjusting the straps and sternum strap in several configurations, but nothing seemed to work as well as I'd hoped.

I don't care much about internal organization and pockets, but there are a reasonable number of slots and internal organization options.

It's nice and compact, but I do not think it suits my needs for bike commuting based on the overall lack of storage space. If it was slightly larger and felt more comfortable on my back I would be a better fan of it. As it is, I think I could only use this when taking the train to work or walking somewhere nearby.
