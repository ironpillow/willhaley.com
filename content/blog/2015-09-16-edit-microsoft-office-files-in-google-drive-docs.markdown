Google does not seem to actively advertise this, but they have a [nice Chrome extension in their Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/office-editing-for-docs-s/gbkeegbaiigmenfmjfclcdgdpimamgkj) that allows for editing `.doc`, `.docx`, and other Microsoft file formats in their native forms.

Typically, when opening one of these Microsoft files, Google creates a copy in their native format (`.gdoc` or whatever the case may be). That is convenient, but sometimes I would prefer to maintain my documents in their original formats.

This extension/plugin for Chrome is a bit limited (it does not auto-save, and I've seen a few other quirks), but it has come in handy when I need to quickly edit Microsoft documents on my Mac.
